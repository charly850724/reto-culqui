    body:
        {
            "s": "barfoofoobarthefoobarman",
            "words": [
                "bar",
                "foo",
                "the"
            ]
        }
```
You should get a response like this:
```
    [
        6,
        9,
        12
    ]
```

This response will be saved in the docker container's local mongo database culqui collection.
